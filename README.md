### Introduction 
The ATP-binding casette (ABC) proteins are a family of ATP dependent transporters in charge of the movement of a broad variety of substances across the plasmatic
membrane and several intracellular compartments. Since these proteins are almost ubiquitously found in all kind of organisms, from prokaryotes to animals, it is speculated that 
they originated very early in life evolution and have divergered in different subfamilies to span a grater variety of biologial functions. 
According to the evolutionary mechanism that give raise to gene homologs (duplication and divergence by mutation), it is expected that closely related family members share a greater
amino acid sequence identity than distantly related ones. Thus it is reasonable that applying an hierarchical clustering algorithm on the sequence similarity data of a set of protein
homologs would reflect the filogenetic history of those proteins.
